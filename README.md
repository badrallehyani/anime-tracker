# THIS IS AN OLD VERSION
Check out [anime-tracker-web](https://github.com/badrallehyani/anime-tracker-web)




# Info
Start by renaming `data.json.removeThis` -> `data.json`

`tracker.py` is the main file. Once tracker is started, it will be controlled by `isOn` file. `isOn` file is controlled by `controller.py`.

So, once Aria2-XMLRPC is On and `conf.json` is correct, run `tracker.py` and run `controller.py` and type in `r` to change `isOn` to 1 which will run the tracker.

In order to add a new anime to the list, use `add.py` file and prompt the info.
